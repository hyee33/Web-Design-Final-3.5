                    <h2>Key Characteristic 1: Assumed Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the most basic aspects of fanfiction is the omission of information, and the assumption that the reader has a background with the original story. 
                        Leavenworth writes, "Fan fiction, however, is always overtly written in relation to its canon and depends on readers' knowledge of this relation."<a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> 
                        Fanfiction often refers to things that either make more sense or can only be understood when one knows the source material, also called "canon." 
                        Fanfics can be read and enjoyed without background, although they generally make more sense when the source material has been read. 
                        Samutina observes from her study and survey of the Russian Harry Potter fandom that:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Moreover, some readers and writers simply follow fandom writers and activists they are fond of, starting from <i>Harry Potter</i> and then wandering from fandom to fandom, sometimes even without a proper acquaintance with the original universes (canons) or without deep immersion into their worlds. 
                        'I don't like this book or series, but I read fanfics based on it, because there are good fandom writers there' - this is another quite common fandom statement.<a href="#source2" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> 
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Many readers of fanfiction are willing to overlook the original confusion when reading fics of a fandom they aren't in, and collect information on the source material over time, to better understand the fanfiction. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fanfiction also generally uses the same world as its source material, and uses or builds off of predone worldbuilding, and assumes that the reader has at least passing familiarity with the material the author is building off of. 
                        "Worldbuilding" is the process of creating and fleshing out a fictional world, which can include language, culture, and geography, among other things. 
                        Fanfiction normally builds off existing worldbuilding, however, it often includes original worldbuilding. 
                        For example, most <i>Star Wars</i> fics use the general worldbuilding of the media, such as the galaxy and basic plot from canon, but explain the Force more because the Force is rather under-developed in canon. 
                        Basing a fanfic off of a preexisting canon allows for a more complete and fleshed-out story in fewer words. 
                        Fanfiction allows for longer and deeper stories with more information than stories where worldbuilding and character building have to be done. 
                        The fic <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3591783/chapters/7921653?view_adult=true">"Embers,"</a> by Vathara, from the Avatar the Last Airbender fandom, is longer than the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy and <i>The Hobbit</i> combined. 
                        Even though "Embers" starts in the middle of canonical events, it would be too long without predone worldbuilding. 
                        The fic wouldn't be possible without the preexisting worldbuilding and character building, as it would be too long. 
                        One benefit of building off of a pre-existing world is that it allows fanfic writers to focus on plot rather than needing to worldbuild, and this is only possible because the reader is assumed to already know the background.
