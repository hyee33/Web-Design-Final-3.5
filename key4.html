                    <h2>Key Characteristic 4: Reader Interaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most important, almost essential, aspect of fanfiction is reader interaction. 
                        Fanfiction involves the reader more than most, if not all, traditional media. 
                        Most forms of media are relatively self contained, and usually don't allow for fans to converse directly with the author. 
                        Fanfiction, however, offers many opportunities for communication, in both directions. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Interaction Between Authors and Readers</h3>
                    <p>
                        One way of interacting is tags, which is one of the main ways authors communicate with readers. 
                        Tags, which were mentioned earlier, inform readers of what to expect from stories. 
                        Tags are where the author communicates fandoms, genres, characters, plot points and tropes, and warnings for situations or plotlines that readers may want to avoid (such as sexual content). 
                        Tags can also be a one-sided conversation between the author and the reader, since authors sometimes add tags that are direct messages to the reader. 
                        The fic <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/29538627">"Let's Plot a Game [A Prequel to Let's Play a Game]"</a> by Jello12451 has tags that include the genre and a warning and some of the authors personal comments, which read: "Angst, Death, Oops, The riddle masters are clueless but also cruel kinda, This is why you guys waited exactly 22 days for the last chapter of Let's Play a Game, RPF kinda except we're all roleplaying lmao, Minimal amounts of Crack but it's there." 
                        Individual tags are separated by commas. 
                        Another fic, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/15644802">"Magic Blankets,"</a> has the following tags: 
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Inspired by Tumblr, I Wrote This Instead of Sleeping, then I cleaned it up and posted it here, magic blankets, C-3PO accidentally saves the Galaxy, Anakin crochets his way into fixing the Galaxy entirely by accident, Crocheting solves everything, Fix-It, I take the canon, I fix the canon, then everybody goes home happy, Weird Force Powers, I mean it's Anakin. 
                        What else did we expect?" 
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        The tags of "Magic Blankets" seem more like the author's unserious summary of the fic than a detailed explanation of what is in it, which is how tags sometimes are. 
                        Using tags as a means of communication can be a useful tool for giving readers information and the author's personal thoughts. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similar to tags, authors' notes are another way fanfiction authors can communicate with readers. 
                        In AO3, authors' notes appear at the end of chapters when the writer chooses to include them. 
                        Since authors' notes are simply a way for authors to write down their thoughts outside of their story, the content of the notes can greatly vary. 
                        Many writers use authors' notes to ask for feedback and ideas and give background or extra details for their story, while others give life updates, provide links to art related to their story, or recommend other fanfiction. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another type of interaction in fanfiction is beta readers. 
                        Beta readers are the editors of fanfics, and are often other fans and fanfic authors, although not always. 
                        They usually pre-read chapters either before they are posted, or soon after, and offer feedback. 
                        Beta readers' input ranges from grammar and syntax corrections to suggestions on how the plot should continue. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Comments are another type of interaction that provides immediate feedback for fanfic authors, and thus influences how a story develops. 
                        After an author posts a chapter, readers have the option of leaving comments, which can range from a single emoji to multiple paragraphs of analysis. 
                        Comments can give the author suggestions and encouragement to write. 
                        Leavenworth observes that, "The constant feedback of an active readership constitutes one reason for writing at all."<a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> 
                        Fanfic authors write not only for themselves but also for their interactive audience. 
                        I have observed countless times that fanfic authors almost always ask for comments, and sometimes feedback. 
                        Comments can be feedback and encouragement direct from readers to writers as well as full conversations. 
                    </p>

                <article>
                    <h3>Interaction Between Fanfics and Fandoms</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fanfics themselves can also be overtly interactive. 
                        The fic <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/27677894/chapters/67732991">"Let's Play a Game,"</a> by Aria_Cinabun, was an interactive fic where the readers had to solve puzzles in order for the story to progress. 
                        As of the writing of this paper, the puzzles themselves have been removed from the fic and notes but are referenced in the comments and in a prequel fic of "Let's Play a Game" (the previously referenced "Let's Plot a Game [A Prequel to Let's Play a Game]"). 
                        There is also a podfic (the fanfiction equivalent of an audiobook) version of the fic, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/28345671/chapters/69448716">"[Podfic] Let's Play a Game (A Reader Interactive Fic)"</a> by Nelle_Reads, which is another way fanfics can interact with each other. 
                        These connected fics—the original, prequel, and podfic—are a good example of the ways fanfics can interact with other fics. 
                        Fanfics can also be less obviously connected, as there are many references and allusions between fics. 
                        An example of references and inspiration between fics is the collection of all fanfiction that includes Tatooine slave culture, which will be explained in greater detail in the next paragraph. 
                        In addition, a great many fanfics cite inspiration from other fics. 
                        One example of a fic that inspired many others is the fic <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/23779702/chapters/57122281">"Road to Nowhere"</a> by Aerugonian from the Boku no Hero Academia and Naruto fandoms. 
                        The fanfic imagines what would happen if a character from Naruto was reincarnated as a character from Boku no Hero Academia into that world. 
                        There are at least 78 fics inspired by "Road to Nowhere."<a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> 
                        Fanfics inspire other fics, which then inspire others, in a cycle of inspiration. 
                        Leavenworth points out that "[a fanfic author] may 'have inadvertently borrowed' material from a plethora of sources."<a href="#source2" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> 
                        Many fanfic writers are also avid readers of fanfiction, and therefore they can't always keep track of where their inspiration came from. 
                        Because of this inspiration and borrowing between fics, sometimes an idea can become so widespread that it becomes fanon. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fanon is collectively agreed upon changes to canon that aren't often explicitly explained by fans. 
                        Ideas, such as a character's history or a name for a character that is not named in the original media, are unconsciously absorbed or consciously copied, and become widespread. 
                        For example, the use of the words "grandmaster" and "grandpadawan" in Star Wars fics are products of the fans and are not used in the original media. 
                        The Tatooine slave culture in the Star Wars fandom is another example of fanon. 
                        One version of the culture was originally created by <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/Fialleril">Fialleril</a>, and has been borrowed completely or served as inspiration for many other fanfics. 
                        Reddit user walaska explains that the series written by Fialleril has, "Inspired countless other fics including some of the big names, like the Desert Storm by Blue Sunshine. 
                        Those inevitably expand upon the work of fialleri [sic] and others, so it's turning into a fanon mishmash that is hard to keep track of."<a href="#source3" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> 
                        In other words, the culture that Fialleril created has been drawn on and copied so many times that it has become bigger than its original creator. 
                        Almost half the tags under <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tatooine%20Slave%20Culture%20*a*%20Customs%20(Star%20Wars)">"Tatooine Slave Culture & Customs (Star Wars)"</a> mention either Fialleril or aspects from Fialleril's creation, and innumerable fanfics draw inspiration from Fialleril and are not tagged.<a href="#source4" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a> 
                        Cultures such as the Tatooine slave culture or Mando'a culture, also from Star Wars, can almost turn into "virtual civilizations" in their own rights.<a href="#source5" class="footnote"><sup>5</sup></a> 
                        Either intentionally or unintentionally, fans work together to create worlds, with the cultures, customs, and mythology implied by those worlds. 
                        Fanon, therefore, is another kind of interaction between all readers and writers of a particular fandom. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as there are interactions between fans and fanfics within a single fandom, fandoms, including fans and fics, also interact with each other. 
                        An example of these interactions is crossover fics, or fics that combine and build on more than one fandom. 
                        Crossover fics may explore what would happen if characters from one world lived in or traveled to a world from another fandom—for example the previously mentioned fic "Road to Nowhere"—or completely combine the two worlds. 
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Interaction is Cooperative</h3>
                    <p>
                        All these different kinds of interactions—between authors and readers, between fics, and between fandoms—highlight the fact that fanfiction is highly cooperative. 
                        Samutina observes that, "Fan fiction readers and writers today are not only the inhabitants of fictional worlds and interactive media environments, but the active transformers of their borders and the concerned co-builders of virtual civilizations and imaginary lives."<a href="#source5" class="footnote"><sup>5</sup></a> 
                        Samutina emphasizes that both fanfiction authors and readers are "transformers of their borders" since they add to and change, or "transform," the original media. 
                        Fanfiction does this through collaboratively creating "virtual civilizations." 
                        For example, fans from the Star Wars fandom have created an entire culture for Tatooine, Darth Vader's home planet. 
                        Fanfic writers and readers are also "co-builders," interacting through comments and beta-ing and working together to create stories. 
                        In other words, fanfiction is cooperative between fans, both readers and writers.
