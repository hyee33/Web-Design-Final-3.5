                    <h2>Sources and Definitions</h2>
                    <p>
                        The fanfiction that I am using as examples was all found on Archive of Our Own (shortened to AO3), an online site that houses a collection of digital creations produced by fans. 
                        AO3 is one of the most popular fanfiction sites, although it is only one of several different well-known sites. 
                        An aspect of most fanfiction sites, not constricted to AO3, are tags, which I will talk about more later. 
                        Tags, on AO3, are how fanfics are sorted and state what fandom, characters, and plot points are included in the fic ("Archive FAQ > Tags"). 
                        Tags appear after the title of the fanfic and can be seen without opening the fic. 
                        Most fanfiction sites allow users to filter tags. 
                        For example, the reader can configure their searching to only display fics with or without a certain tag. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that readers will have an easier time understanding my points, I have picked somewhat popular or at least recognizable fandoms to draw from. 
                        I'll primarily use stories and examples from the <i>Star Wars</i>, Harry Potter, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Boku no Hero Academia, Dream SMP, and Sherlock Holmes fandoms. 
                        For those unfamiliar with these stories, I will give a brief and surface-level summary. 
                        The <i>Star Wars</i> movies are set in space, and follow a boy who learns he can use the Force (a somewhat supernatural power) and saves the galaxy. 
                        The book series Harry Potter, by J. K. Rowling, is about a boy attending a school for magic, and who ultimately fights the villain who threatens the magical world. 
                        Avatar: The Last Airbender is a TV show that focuses on the last person in the world who can "bend" or manipulate the element air, and his quest to save the world from the opposition. 
                        Written by Kōhei Horikoshi, the Japanese comic series Boku no Hero Academia follows a boy and his class through superhero school and all the difficulties and villains that entails. 
                        The Dream SMP is a Minecraft server, where Twitch streamers and YouTubers improv and roleplay as characters in a complex storyline. 
                        Finally, the Sherlock Holmes collection of short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle chronicles the adventures of the title character and his sidekick, Watson, as they solve mysteries. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a final note, a word that will appear often is "media." 
                        I define media as any existing set of a world and the characters that inhabit that world, and is usually a story in some form. 
                        Some common examples of media would be a book or a movie; a less obvious example would be the story produced by roleplay and improvisation inside a video game.
