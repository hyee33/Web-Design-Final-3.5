                    <h2>Categorizing Fanfiction</h2>
                    <h3>Some Common Definitions of Fanfiction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Despite its popularity, there is no agreed upon definition for fanfiction, also called "fanfics" or simply "fics," although many people have offered their own ideas of how it should be defined. 
                        For instance, Maria Lindgren Leavenworth in "The Paratext of Fan Fiction" defines fanfiction as "online-published, most often pseudonymously authored stories which take a pre-existing fiction, a canon is fanfic vernacular, as a starting point."<a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> 
                        While this definition may be applicable to most fanfiction, fanfics are not always published online. 
                        Some of the first fanfics were in physical Star Trek magazines from the 1960s called "fan-zines," which were "non-professional magazines produced by and circulating among enthusiastic fans."<a href="#source2" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> 
                        Natalia Samutina in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2016.1141863">"Fan Fiction as World-Building: Transformative Reception in Crossover Writing"</a> argues that fanfiction is "quite often defined primarily by its opposition to originality: instead of coming up with his/her own, a fan fiction writer takes someone else's worlds and characters."<a href="#source3" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> 
                        I would argue, however, that fanfiction is not an opposition to originality; instead of "taking" pre-existing ideas, writers build off of them. 
                        Kasper Bro Larsen in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0039338X.2018.1552894">"Fan Fiction and Early Christian Apocrypha"</a> also attempts to defines fanfiction as: 
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Moreover, some readers and writers simply follow fandom writers and activists they are fond of, starting from <i>Harry Potter</i> and then wandering from fandom to fandom, sometimes even without a proper acquaintance with the original universes (canons) or without deep immersion into their worlds. 
                        'I don't like this book or series, but I read fanfics based on it, because there are good fandom writers there' - this is another quite common fandom statement.<a href="#source3" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Similarly to Leavenworth's definition, this applies to most fanfiction, although the writers of fanfiction are not always fans of the original story. 
                        The current definitions of fanfiction are inadequate. 
                        As seen in Leavenworth's, Samutina's, and Larsen's definitions, they do not account for its publication medium, originality, and writer affiliation. 
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>My Definition</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have observed that there are certain aspects that most fanfiction shares: assumed background, catalyst of diversion, original literary devices, and reader interaction. 
                        While not all fanfics contain all of these aspects, most do; these are not elements that fanfiction is required to have, simply commonalities shared between most fanfiction stories. 
                        Despite these aspects being fundamental to fanfiction, they do not constitute a definition, so I will suggest one. 
                        I would define fanfiction as: 
                    </p>
                    <blockquote> <i>fiction inspired by another piece of media, that generally builds off of elements from the original media. </i> </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This might seem like too broad of a definition, but fanfiction itself is extremely varied, and any attempts at further specification would exclude fiction that I would classify as fanfiction. 
                        It is inherently original, whether simply adding a scene or completely reimagining the whole plot, and fanfiction is simply fiction that has recognizable and purposeful “points of contact” to another piece of media, however far it might travel from that original media.<a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>
                        Thus, fanfiction includes stories such as <i>The Aeneid</i> of Virgil, many of Shakespeare's plays, and basically all remakes and adaptations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This broad definition is necessary because fanfiction is a growing part of our current culture: fanfiction can be a large part of how people interact with stories. 
                        Writing and reading fanfiction is a way to extend interaction by not simply reading or watching a story, but contributing to it with one's own ideas and thoughts. 
                        The combination of these ideas and the way they are communicated has created a unique culture. 
                        This culture of fanfiction includes and is created by every reader and writer; it is different from other literary cultures because it is communal. 
                        It is made up of individual creativity, contributed by distinct writers, and communal creativity, molded by the whole collection of writers, beta readers, commenters, and readers working in conjunction. 
                        The culture of fanfiction is one that aims to add to and expand every world that inspires anyone. 
                        This community, collectively, is “so creative they decided to change the world itself… and it worked.”<a href="#source4" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a>
