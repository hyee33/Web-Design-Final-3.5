                    <h2>Key Characteristic 2: Catalyst of Diversion</h2>
                    <p>
                        While fanfiction builds off of pre-existing media, the most foundational key element of fanfiction is the change(s) that fanfic writers make to that media. 
                        Fanfiction stories always change at least one element of the original story. 
                        Changes can range from a different setting and the same characters, different characters and the same setting, a different background and same characters and setting, and more. 
                        Some fanfics make a small change, such as adding a new scene or event, that doesn't change the grand scheme of the plot. 
                        For example, the fic "Things that Haunt Our Hallways" by Ghostwriterofthemachine, from the Boku no Hero Academia fandom, focuses on what would happen if a fear gas was accidentally used on the main character's class and how they would react. 
                        The concept of "fear gas" is used in traditional media, however, Ghostwriterofthemachine takes the concept and applies it to a new setting. 
                        This new event is theoretically possible, in regards to canon, and does not drastically change the plot. 
                        However, in another fic, "Magic Blankets" by Lady_Lombax, from the <i>Star Wars</i> fandom, one small change snowballs, changing the whole ending of the original <i>Star Wars</i> series. 
                        In the fic, C3PO teaches Anakin to crochet, which eventually saves the galaxy by giving Anakin a healthy outlet for his emotions, which keeps him from becoming Darth Vader and thus saves the universe. 
                        While the impact and substance of what a fanfiction writer changes can vary, one universal aspect of fanfiction is that something is always changed from the original media. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One example is that many fanfics contain mostly original worldbuilding with predone characters. 
                        A respondent to Samutina's survey explains why they expand a pre-existing universe with their own ideas. 
                        The writer states, "It is difficult to use the author's canon for the development of characters. 
                        You don't know its undercurrents, don't see its nuances. You feel much more confident in a world created in your head" <a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
                        As the respondent explains, it can be easier for authors to do their own worldbuilding than rely on what is contained in canon. 
                        Almost all <i>Star Wars</i> fanfics are good examples of this inability to rely on canon. 
                        The fic "Fundamental Force Carriers" by Tanarill from the <i>Star Wars</i> fandom invents a new way for the Force to work, which, in turn, changes the plot of canon drastically, by making "balance in the Force" require both the Dark and Light sides. 
                        The Force is not well-explained in canon, so most authors come up with their own system. 
                        While sometimes authors draw from other sources, oftentimes they come up with completely original worldbuilding. 
                        Samutina observes that worldbuilding is a "creative operation" that includes "creative inventiveness, fantasy, logic and the need to avoid contradiction, etc." <a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
                        Expanding a world and adding to it is complicated, and sometimes authors change aspects of the original world for their fics even if those aspects don't appear in their writing. 
                        Despite the complexity, a multitude of fics contain original worldbuilding that makes the stories they write richer and more enjoyable.

                    <h3>Original Stories</h3>
                    <p>
                        More often than not, the end result of a fic is a completely different story than what was published in the original media. 
                        In other words, one could classify fanfictions as original stories with predone worldbuilding and character building. 
                        One example of an essentially original story is the fic "Throw a Chair Through a Window and Call It a Day," by Jaded_ghoster, from the Boku no Hero Academia fandom. 
                        The fic explores a what-if scenario in which the main character's chaotic teacher becomes the principal of the school and the main character becomes his assistant. 
                        While the characters are "borrowed" from canon, their reactions are completely from the author's imagination, and therefore original. 
                        In a similar vein, fanfiction can also fill out worldbuilding from the author's imagination, which essentially creates an original story. 
                        The fic "Embers" builds off of the original media by adding and changing a culture from the media, and thus creates an original story. 
                        A writer and respondent to Samutina's survey noted that readers have reported enjoying their works as stand-alone stories. 
                        The author states, "Many times readers have told me that [my] story would not have lost its appeal as an original story" <a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
                        A great number of fanfiction stories would almost be able to stand as traditional stories, with the exception that they borrow from pre-existing media.
