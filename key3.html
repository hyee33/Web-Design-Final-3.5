                    <h2>Key Characteristic 3: Literary Devices</h2>
                    <h3>Fanfictions' Original Tropes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Along with assumption of background and catalyst of diversion, another key aspect of fanfiction is its literary devices, which include original tropes and genres. 
                        Fanfiction includes a different set of tropes than traditional media. 
                        This is possibly due to the ratio of a large volume of fanfiction to a smaller number of trained writers. 
                        The large majority of fanfiction authors are not professionally trained; as a result, ideas, including tropes, are recycled if they are useful for writing. 
                        Leavenworth states, "Most readers come to fan fiction with the understanding that the story they read has been written by a hobby-ist rather than a professional" <a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
                        The large majority of readers are willing to look past common or overused plot points and tropes. 
                        Some common tropes are <i>Enemies to Lovers</i>, <i>Friends to Lovers</i>, <i>Coffee Shop</i>, and <i>Soulmates</i>. 
                        Half of these tropes also appear in traditional media, but are used in fanfiction to a much greater degree. 
                        In the <i>Enemies to Lovers</i> trope, two characters start as enemies and end up in a romantic relationship. 
                        In a similar vein, in <i>Friends to Lovers</i> two characters start as friends and end up in a romantic relationship. 
                        For the <i>Coffee Shop</i> trope, the fanfic is set in or around a coffee shop; for example, characters could work in a coffee shop, or meet there for the first time. 
                        In the <i>Soulmates</i> trope, peoples' souls are connected in some way, and the characters meet and/or learn of this connection. 
                        This trope is normally romantic, but not always, and the way peoples' souls are connected varies greatly. 
                        The most common tropes are usually romantic, such as <i>Enemies to Lovers</i> or <i>Soulmates</i>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While fanfiction uses traditional tropes, it also includes fandom specific ones, such as the <i>Party Host Jackson Wang</i> trope in the K-Pop fandom. 
                        Whenever there is a party, generally in college, the K-pop singer Jackson Wang is the host; I was unable to determine why Jackson Wang in particular was chosen to be the party host. 
                        Despite there not being a universally used tag for this trope, there are still lots of tags that point to the trope's popularity. 
                        Some include: "inevitable jackson cameo during a house party," "It's Not A K-Pop Party Fic Without Jackson Wang," "Jackson Wang as the obligatory K-Pop Party host," "obligatory jackson wang party," and "there's a jackson wang party cause a fic is incomplete without him" <a href="#source2" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a>. 
                        These tags seem self-aware and self-referential, and attest to how well-known and even expected this trope is in some fandoms. 
                        Fandom specific tropes can become very widespread.

                    <h3>Tropes in Traditional Media, and the Overlap in Fanfiction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tropes still occur in traditional media, however, they either occur less often or are less easy to track. 
                        Some examples appear in Hallmark movies, which are known for having predictable plots and include tropes like <i>Love at First Sight</i>, a trope common in romance movies. 
                        Another common trope from traditional media is the <i>Chosen One</i>, where only one person (the Chosen One character) is able to do something, such as save the world. 
                        The <i>Chosen One</i> trope appears in <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Ender's Game</i>, and even the legends of King Arthur. 
                        While some of these traditional tropes do occur in fanfiction, they are more often a part of the original media than the focus of the fanfiction. 
                        For example, a show's main character might be a Chosen One, while a fanfiction written about that character (the Chosen One) uses the <i>Coffee Shop</i> trope. 
                        While this concept may sound confusingly complicated, in actuality all it means is that fanfics can contain both tropes that are used in traditional media and tropes that originated in fanfiction at the same time; the two styles of tropes are not mutually exclusive.

                    <h3>Fanfiction's Original Genres</h3>
                    <p>
                        Along with original tropes, fanfiction has some original genres, or literary classifications of stories or media. 
                        While some might say that fanfiction is a genre of its own, the wide variety in writing style and content material included in fanfiction writings has produced its own unique genres. 
                        Samutina agrees, commenting, "Fan fiction today is extremely diverse and cannot be reduced to a single genre" <a href="#source3" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
                        Some examples of genres original to fanfiction include <i>fluff</i>, <i>dark</i>, <i>angst</i>, and <i>crack</i>, which are terms that the fanfiction community as a whole has accepted. 
                        Despite my best efforts to pin down the originators, the definitions and uses of these genres seem to have arisen organically from the community; the terms are almost universally used, as of the writing of this paper. 
                        <i>Fluff</i> fanfics are fics that give the reader a warm fuzzy heartwarming feeling, often they are stories where only good things happen. 
                        In direct contrast, <i>dark</i> fics are ones where a lot of things go wrong and happy endings are not to be expected; they may also include disturbing elements. 
                        In <i>angst</i> fics, the characters usually go through a lot of mental pain, such as guilt or depression. 
                        <i>Crack</i> fics are fanfics in which something crazy, unexpected, or just plain impossible happens; they are generally humorous but can also be thought provoking. 
                        Most fanfics include a mix of these genres, although some do fall into only one category. 
                        Fanfics can also include a mix of traditional genres as well as fanfic-specific ones, for example a fic could fall under the genres <i>mystery</i> and <i>angst</i>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fanfics also often change the genre of the original story. 
                        For example, a fanfic from the Sherlock Holmes fandom called "…fantastically, wildly improbable…" by Notjustmom and scrub456 changes the source material's genre of <i>mystery</i> into <i>comedy</i>. 
                        Additionally, fandoms where the source material is generally dark, or heavy, tend to have lighter fics, while lighter fandoms tend to have darker fics. 
                        One example is how a lot of fanfiction in the Dream SMP fandom often is in the <i>dark</i> genre despite the original media being light hearted in general. 
                        Even though the streams and videos which make up the source material are usually lighthearted and playful, the story created by them is implied to be quite dark. 
                        Despite the genre of the source material being something like <i>comedy</i>, a large amount of the inspired fanfiction tends to focus on the heavier elements of the storyline and change the genre into something darker, when not changing the story entirely.

                    <h3>Characters and Their Use in Fanfiction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Similarly to how fanfiction has developed original tropes and genres, fanfic authors have also almost developed their own style of stock characters. 
                        Since readers know how a character in the original media will normally act and react, the character becomes similar to a "stock character." 
                        In other words, the author does not have to do as much character building since they can pull from the readers' own knowledge of the character. 
                        A respondent to Samutina's survey explains, "To raise the periscope above the surface marked 'glasses and green eyes' (Harry Potter as he is) is enough for the reader to see a huge submarine, stuffed with [the] reader's own ideas about this character, his emotional luggage, appearance, and skills" <a href="#source3" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
                        An author mentioning some well-known or defining factor of a character, in this case Harry Potter's "glasses and green eyes," is enough for the reader to call to mind all the other details of the character from the original media that are not explicitly stated in the fic. 
                        Mentioning these defining characteristics also prompts readers to insert their own ideas and interpretation of the original media, which in turn colors how they interpret the fanfiction.
