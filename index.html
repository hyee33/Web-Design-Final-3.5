                    <h2>About This Website</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are "So, so, so many stories to tell, and not enough time to tell them all," which is perhaps why fanfiction is so popular: people tell the stories that published media has not yet told.<a href="#source1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> 
                        In any case, fanfiction has become popular; one site that holds fanfiction, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/">Archive of Our Own</a>, has over seven million users, and even more readers who do not have accounts.<a href="#source2" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> 
                        Despite the already wide-spread and still growing amount of fanfiction readers and writers, there is not much academic literature and analysis of fanfiction. 
                        This may be because there are many misconceptions that people have about fanfiction. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One common assumption that people have about fanfiction is that it is not well written, and is only written by amateurs, specifically teenage girls. 
                        Actually, a great number of fanfics have high quality writing, and follow the conventional rules of writing. 
                        Fanfiction authors are also not all amateurs; many have had quite a lot of practice, or professional training. 
                        Published authors have said that they have written or still write fanfiction, including Andy Weir, who wrote <i>The Martian</i>, and Naomi Novik, who wrote the Temeraire series.<a href="#source3" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="#source4" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a> 
                        Finally, while the majority of fanfiction writers and readers are female, not all are teenagers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this website is to provide information about the literary aspects of fanfiction. 
                        While others have discussed fanfiction, they have looked at different areas, including LGBTQ+ themes and legality. 
                        Leading from legality, there is an issue of morality when dealing with fanfiction, but it is not relevant or covered in this website.

                    <h2>About the Author</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am in my senior year of highschool and am homeschooled. 
                        I love reading and creating things with my hands. 
                        One of my favorite books is <i>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</i> by Douglas Adams. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been an avid reader of fanfiction since I began highschool, and have the habit of reading fics for works of media that I have not watched/read. 
                        Some of my favorite fanfics are <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/28895850/chapters/70888881">"You Heard It First From Charlie"</a> by Anonymous, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24798505/chapters/59972725">"Complicated Creation"</a> by Elemental, and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/41547801/chapters/104206269">"Monolithic"</a> by fluffy_papaya.
